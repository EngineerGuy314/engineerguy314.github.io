Solar System is a kit that makes making your own solar panels easy.

The Solar System works for any tracker, but also has special features making it work especially well with <a href="/tracker" target="_blank">Traquito Jetpack tracker</a>.

The cost of kit + solar cells for a tracker is less than $1.00.

Solar cells have a positive and negative side, and produce 0.5v voltage apiece.
<img src="cell_front_back.png">

A solar panel is an arrangement of cells, and in the case of trackers, cells in series to equal a higher combined voltage.

That means soldering the cells in series (front to back), just as you would combine batteries to achieve a higher voltage.

In this diagram, we see 6 cells assembled into a panel which has 3.0v output.

Here is a similar 3-cell view from the side:

Solar cells are very fragile!

Solar cells are very tricky to solder to.

Solar cells then need to be arranged on some kind of support structure (a panel) and mounted to a tracker in order to fly with it.

This is very error prone and time consuming (and boring).

They key feature of Solar System is a 3-cell jig you use to solder the cells back-to-front.

That is this PCB:
<img src="ss3.png">

You put one PCB on the top of the solar cells, another PCB on the bottom, and solder them together.

The internal circuitry of the PCB will make sure that once soldered, the electrical connections of the cells are back-to-front.

<img src="ss_cells_in_series_top_annotated.png">

Once you have one set of 3 cells assembled, make another.

Combine the two 3-cell jigs together using another PCB in the middle and you'll have yourself a 6-cell panel.

The 6 cells in series make 3.0v -- that's enough to power a tracker.

<span class="highlight">The orientation of the 3-cell jig PCB is <span class="bold">critical</span>.</span>

The arrows on the PCB must face in <span class="bold highlight">opposite directions</span> on the top and bottom.

Take note that the silkscreen marks the 3 sections where each cell goes, each with 3 oval slots per-cell.

Solder the cells into place both on the top and bottom.  No need to use more than one oval per-side per-cell.  No need fill the oval with solder, just use enough to make the connection.

This amount of solder is just fine:

Top View:

Bottom View:

Once you have soldered the cells in place, solder the plated holes throughout the strip.

Best if you have a fine-point soldering iron which you can stick into each hole, swirl around, and feed enough solder such that the two PCBs become connected across the small vertical gap separating them.

<img src="ss_cells_in_series_top_solder_holes.png">

It can be very helpful to weigh the cells and PCBs down as you work through them.  A pair of cutters with padded handles works very well.

Combine the two 3-cell jigs together using the center piece.

<span class="bold highlight">The arrows must all point in the same direction (eg left to right).</span>

Simply place a 3-cell jig on top of the center piece, then melt the solder from the jig into the center piece.

Do that for each side.

<img src="ss_6cells_series.png">


Note -- The arrows point to the plated circle at the end of the 3-cell jig.

The circle the arrows point to has the same charge as the side of the cells you're looking at.

Put simply:
<ul>
<li>If you're looking at the top of the cells (negative), the arrows point to the negative circle</li>
<li>If you're looking at the bottom of the cells (positive), the arrows point to the positive circle</li>
</ul>
Once you have assembled the 6-cell panel, the above still holds true, but now across 6 cells.
