            <pre class="text">
Jetpack inherits RPi Pico features and extends them through the Add-on Module.

The RPi Pico provides:
<li>RP2040 CPU
<li>Flash Memory
<li>Temperature sensor
<li>USB and support for Drag/Drop software upload

The RP2040 is run at a reduced 48MHz speed to balance conserving power while retaining fast computation.

The flash memory is used to permanently store user configuration across power resets.

Temperature sensing makes use of the internal temperature sensor of the RP2040 instead of an external component, saving board space and cost.

The USB interface allows for both easy uploading of the Jetpack software, as well as interactive configuration and testing of the device before flight.


The Add-on Module provides:
<li>GPS (ATGM336H)
<li>Radio Transmitter (SI5351A) + 0.5ppm TCXO
<li>Voltage Monitor


<u>GPS Details</u>
The GPS uses signals from both the US GPS satellite system as well as the BEIDOU GPS satellite system.

The design places the GPS and its antenna pads far away from electrical noise, for improved lock speed and quality.
Sensitive GPS areas are shielded with "via fencing."


<u>Radio Transmitter Details</u>
The Radio Transmitter consists of the SI5351A device.

For stronger transmissions, instead of a single clock source used as the radio signal, two clocks are used, 180 degrees phase from one another for double driving power.
Each clock drives one leg of the dipole antenna, each at the maximum output current (8mA).

No TCXO calibration or correction is required for proper operation.

The Radio Transmitter antenna pads are placed away from sources of noise.

To avoid transmission frequency drift in cold or changing temperatures, the radio is powered up 30 seconds before transmissions to allow for stabilization.


<u>Voltage Monitor Details</u>
Solar-powered flight is common in pico balloon tracker configurations.
The unpredictable and wide range of supplied power from solar can sometimes create instability in hardware designed to operate within a specific range.

Jetpack incorporates a dedicated hardware-only voltage monitoring device which can rescue the system in the event of a lockup due to under-power conditions.

The monitor looks for supply voltages below 2.6v as an indication of system fault and holds the system in reset for a short period to clear the issue.

        <section class="content">
            <span class="heading">Jetpack Software</span>
            
            <pre class="text">
The software that operates the Jetpack tracker hardware is designed to be simple, intuitive, and fault-tolerant.

Jetpack software operates in two modes:
<li>Configuration Mode
<li>Flight Mode


<u>Configuration Mode</u>
Configuration mode is automatically selected whenever you plug Jetpack into the computer through USB.

Jetpack assumes you want to configure or test your device, so the GPS and Radio transmiter are turned on automatically in preparation.

In this mode, you have flexibility to set your flight details (band, channel, callsign) as well as test the hardware features of the device.

Configuring and interacting with Jetpack is easy.  Jetpack speaks WebSerial, meaning you use a web browser, mouse, and keyboard to interact with it just as you would any other webpage.

The settings you supply are saved in permanent memory and persist across reboots and power outages.


<u>Flight Mode</u>
When Jetpack is disconnected from USB, it automatically enables Flight Mode.

On startup in Flight Mode, Jetpack first checks that you have saved Flight Configuration (band, channel, callsign).

If there is no saved Flight Configuration, a "panic" rapid-flashing LED pattern appears, and the device resets itself a few moments later, and the cycle repeats.

You cannot fly a "default" configuration of any kind.  If you fly Jetpack with no configuration, it will do nothing, there will be no transmissions.

Assuming Flight Configuration is found, Jetpack looks up the transmission schedule associated with the band and channel, and begins its Tracker Cycle.

The Tracker Cycle consists of:
<li>Get a GPS lock
<li>Idle until 30 seconds before it is time to transmit
<li>Turn on the radio transmitter early to warm it up and reduce frequency drift
<li>Transmit Regular message, then Encoded message

Jetpack only transmits messages when a GPS lock has been acquired.

This cycle repeats endlessly as long as there is power.  If power is lost and later restored, this cycle starts again.

You can visually determine what phase of this sequence Jetpack is in by monitoring the blinking pattern of the LED on the RPi Pico.

The blinking patterns you can see are:
<li>Short blink every 1 second - GPS is waiting for a lock
<li>Short blink every 5 seconds - Idle period before transmission
<li>Alternating on/off every 1 second - Radio operational for warmup and transmission

In addition to the blink patterns during the Tracker Cycle, you will also see a special sequence on startup, consisting of one blink (indicating power on), followed by 3 blinks (indicating Flight Configuration found).


<u>Flight Mode Fault-Tolerance</u>
In the event of a hardware malfunction or lockup, the system uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer" target="_blank">Watchdog timer</a> that will reset the entire device within seconds instead of locking up for the entire day.

Jetpack can also deal with a malfunctioning GPS device.  If no GPS lock occurs within 20 minutes of the attempt, a software and hardware (power) reset of the GPS is performed, after which Jetpack resets itself, resolving any issue in the process.

            <span class="heading">Jetpack Weight</span>
            
            <pre class="text">
Jetpack weighs a combined 5.3 grams for RPi Pico + Add-on Module.

        <section class="content">
            <span class="heading">Jetpack Power Consumption</span>
            
            <pre class="text">
Jetpack requires a maximum of 60mA at 3.3v to operate.
The higher the voltage, the less current required.

There are 3 major consumers of power (highest to lowest):
<li>Radio Transmitter
<li>GPS
<li>The board iself

Jetpack saves power in Flight Mode by only powering the Radio Transmitter and GPS when they are in use.
As a result, power consumption is not constant, but varies over time depending on the active operation.
